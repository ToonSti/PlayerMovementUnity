Sharing my research on player movement in Unity with C#.

Containing:
  - A file with removed code methods called "Methods.cs"
  - A file containing all used sources with link called "Sources.txt"
  - Commentary on the code explaining what it does or what its function is

Functions:
  - SmoothDamp and normalized 3d person player movement
  - Smoothened PLayer Rotation
  - Aircontrol option
  - No double jump
  - Player animations
  - Character Controller
  - Controllable and following Camera without Cinemachine
  - Groundcheck working on ledges and slopelimit
  - Sprinting and Crouching

Note:
  - Crouching changes the transformheight, I could change it so it only changes the collider, but this works best for me.
