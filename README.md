# PlayerMovementUnity

Sharing my research on player movement in Unity with C#.

---
Containing:
  - A file with removed code methods called "Methods.cs"
  - A file containing all used sources with link called "Sources.txt"
  - Commentary on the code explaining what it does or what its function is
  
---
Functions:
  - SmoothDamp and normalized player movement
  - Smoothened PLayer Rotation
  - Aircontrol option
  - No double jump
  - Player animations

Want to add:
  - Making SmoothDamp function slower in air when no button pressed for a smoother landing
  - Making a character controller with it
